Look for how role expectations, status differences, and functional silos shape how people describe pain points. The same bottleneck might be invisible to one role and critical to another.\n\n**Attribution Patterns**\nNotice how stakeholders explain process problems. Do they attribute issues to individual behavior, systemic factors, or external constraints? Attribution patterns reveal underlying beliefs about change and responsibility that will affect how recommendations are received.\n\n**Psychological Safety Signals**\nPay attention to what stakeholders seem comfortable sharing versus hesitant to discuss. These signals indicate the organizational culture around feedback and change, which will be crucial for your implementation recommendations.\n\n**Questions for Your Analysis**\n- Where do stakeholder narratives converge, and where do they diverge? What explains the differences?\n- What emotions accompany different parts of the process (frustration, confusion, resignation)?\n- What have stakeholders already tried to improve the process, and why didn't it work?"
