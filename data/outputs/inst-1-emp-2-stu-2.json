Each stakeholder's experience is a character arc within that journey. Your process map should reveal where the narrative breaks down-where confusion, frustration, or abandonment occur.\n\n**Visual Hierarchy in Process Maps**\nNot all steps are equally important. Use visual weight (size, color, position) to distinguish critical decision points from routine steps. Highlight the pain points your stakeholders identified using visual emphasis techniques.\n\n**The Power of Before/After**\nYour eventual recommendations will be more compelling if the current state documentation clearly shows what's broken. Design your visuals now with an eye toward the transformation story you'll tell later.\n\n**Questions for Your Design**\n- How can you show the emotional experience of the process, not just the steps?\n- What visual metaphors might make abstract problems tangible (bottlenecks, loops, dead ends)?\n- How can your process map serve both as documentation and as a persuasive tool for change?"
