            "content": "As you conduct thematic analysis this week, use organizational psychology frameworks to deepen your interpretation:\n\n**Job Demands-Resources Model**\nLook at the onboarding process through this lens: What demands does it place on new employees (cognitive load, time pressure, uncertainty)? What resources does it provide (support, information, autonomy)? An imbalance predicts stress and early turnover.\n\n**Psychological Contract Theory**\nNew employees arrive with implicit expectations about what the organization will provide. Your interview themes may reveal where these psychological contracts are being violated during onboarding-broken promises, unmet expectations, or miscommunication about role scope.\n\n**Socialization Tactics**\nClassic research distinguishes between 'serial' socialization (learning from experienced mentors) and 'disjunctive' (figuring it out alone), 'investiture' (affirming newcomer identity) and 'divestiture' (breaking down to rebuild). Which tactics does Horizon use, and how do stakeholders experience them?\n\n**Questions for Your Analysis**\n- What themes reflect systemic organizational issues versus individual experiences?\n- Where do new employee experiences diverge from what managers intended?\n- What emotional undertones accompany different themes (frustration, confusion, alienation, resilience)?\n- How might equity considerations shape different employees' onboarding experiences?"
