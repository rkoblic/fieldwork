Use visual contrast (before/after, problem/solution) to make the value proposition immediate and compelling.\n\n**Cognitive Load in Recommendations**\nLeadership has limited attention. Design your recommendations with progressive disclosure: the core message visible immediately, supporting details available on demand. Consider a 'pyramid' structure with the key recommendation at the top.\n\n**Inclusive Design as Portfolio Differentiator**\nEmployers increasingly value inclusive design skills. Document how you considered accessibility (color contrast, alt text, multiple formats) and equity (whose voices are represented, who might be affected by recommendations). This demonstrates professional maturity.\n\n**Building Buy-In Through Visuals**\nStakeholders who see themselves in your visuals are more likely to support recommendations. Include quotes from interviews, represent diverse employee perspectives, and show how recommendations address specific pain points different groups identified.\n\n**Questions for Your Design**\n- How can your visuals show the 'why' behind recommendations, not just the 'what'?\n- What stakeholder quotes or data points would make recommendations feel grounded in real experience?\n- How will you test these visuals with different audience members before final presentation?\n- What makes these pieces portfolio-worthy? How do they demonstrate your unique value as a communicator?"
